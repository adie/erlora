This project implements C++ OCCI port program for enabling Erlang
communications with Oracle database server.

To get started you need to properly set ERLHOME and OCCIHOME in
`c_src/Makefile` and lib versions in `priv/ora.rel` (if you run `make`,
erlc will tell you what versions you have).

Run `make`. If all went ok you should have `priv/oraserver` executable
and `ebin/ora.boot` script.

To try it out, run

`erl -pa ../erlora/ebin`

and in erlang shell execute

1> application:start(ora).
ok
2> {ok, Pid} = ora:connect("user/password@hostname/sid", []).
{ok,<0.39.0>}

and then you should be able to execute any functions of `ora` module passing
obtained `Pid`.
